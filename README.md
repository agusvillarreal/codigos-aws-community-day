# Attack codes demos

## AWS Community Day Mexico 2025

This repository contains source code examples demonstrating various attack vectors against MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, which are referenced in the presentation for AWS Community Day Mexico 2025.

### Purpose

The code samples provided here are for educational purposes only, designed to illustrate security vulnerabilities discussed in the `mcp-security-implementation.md` document. Understanding these attack vectors is essential for implementing proper security measures in your own server implementations.

### Contents

- Attack vector demonstrations
- Exploit code examples
- Security vulnerability illustrations

### Disclaimer

These examples should only be used in controlled environments against systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use of these attack codes against production servers may be illegal and is not endorsed.

### Usage

Please refer to the `mcp-security-implementation.md` file for detailed explanations of each vulnerability and corresponding security implementation recommendations.
